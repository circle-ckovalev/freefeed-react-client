      <p>
        The Circle is a private social network for alumni of Andrei Kovalev&apos;s courses who share
        an active commitment to photography and the visual arts. It follows many of the same social
        media conventions we are all used to: each member has a profile, can interact with posts
        from other users, and can subscribe to various groups per their interests.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are automatically subscribed to the <Link to="/circle">official Circle</Link> account.
        Don&apos;t forget that you can subscribe to another member&apos;s feeds to follow their
        posts!
      </p>
